          Wanted: Part-time nanny on Mon, Wed, Fri from 9AM - 5PM in central

        <h3>About the job</h3>
        <p>
          The job is looking after our baby daughter, Lottie! We need someone
          who can come to our home in central Phoenix and watch her during the
          day while my wife and I work. You'll feed her, change her, bounce her
          on her bouncer, put her down for a nap, read her a book, etc., baby
          stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lottie was born in August so she'll be about 3 months old by November,
          which is when we need you to start (that is when mom has to go back to
          work). My wife and I both work from home, so we'll be around during
          the day, but in our offices (one's in the house, one's out back). You
          and Lottie will have the run of the kitchen, living room and nursery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also to note, we have pets: one is a very friendly Golden Retriever,
          and another is a very fluffy cat.
        </p>

        <h3>Days/Hours</h3>
        <p>
          We would like you to be at our home from 9AM to 5PM on Mondays,
          Wednesdays and Fridays. The days and hours are somewhat flexible, so
          we may be able to work with your schedule where possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          My wife and I are visiting family for the week over Christmas, so we
          will not need care that week. Additionally, if you need time off
          during the holidays we are happy to accommodate whatever you need - I
          have a few weeks off near the end of December.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>When does the job start/end?</h3>
        <p>
          Monday November 8th - that is when Mom has to go back to work.
          However, we are going to visit Great Grandma on Friday November 12th.
          So the first week is actually only Monday and Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          We anticipate a need for care for at least a year, and probably
          longer. So ideally you are able to commit to the job for at least a
          year!

        <h3>COVID Stuff</h3>
        <p>
          My wife and I are vaccinated against COVID-19, and we would like our
          daughter's nanny to be vaccinated, too. Once we decided we are a good
          fit for one another, we will require that you send us a copy of your
          vaccination card (we're happy to provide ours, too).
